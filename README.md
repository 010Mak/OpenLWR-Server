# OpenLWR-Server

Serverside component of OpenLWR, handles communication with clients and runs the simulation calculations.

running this should be as simple as running `pip install -r requirements.txt` and running `python main.py`

very big thanks to Goosey (fluff.goose on discord) for writing the original reactor physics in lua
